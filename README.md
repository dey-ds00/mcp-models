# mcp-models

This repository contains **MCP-integrated tools and agents**.  
Each folder inside the repo represents an independent agent or tool built using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.

## ðŸ”¹ What is MCP?

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that allows AI models and agents to connect with external tools, APIs, and data sources.  
Think of it as a universal interface for extending model capabilities.



- Each folder = **one MCP-integrated agent/tool**.  
- Every agent/tool comes with its own `README.md` for usage instructions.
